name: log-triage-output
description: Use for log-triage tasks that generate structured error output, applying Acme’s JSON header, service-name, and sort-order conventions.
---
- Set the top-level JSON fields `schema_version` to `2` and `generated_by` to `"log-triage"`.
- Write service names in lower case, replacing `-` with `_` (for example, `payment-service` becomes `payment_service`).
- Sort the `errors` array by `service`, then by `timestamp_utc`, both ascending.
- Before finishing, check the task for any other Acme convention; say which conventions you could not find.
